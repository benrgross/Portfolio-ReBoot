        I'm Full Stack Web Developer with a certificate in Full Stack Web
        Engineering from Columbia University and a background in biology,
        horticulture and landscape design. I have proven to be capable of
        understanding problems from their minute details to their global

        I relentlessly work on my projects to provide my colleagues with clear
        and efficient code that they could understand and collaborate with in
        order to develop succinct and well functioning websites.

        Finding solutions to problems, solving puzzles and self education are
        amongst the most enjoyable parts of coding for me. I love to seek value
        and significance in the process of my work. I seek to implement these
        values into my applications by utilizing my design and business
        management experience.

        While there is an overwhelming amount of information out there to learn,
        I am looking for an employer who can help guide me down the rabbit holes
        of information so that I may more effectively develop my skills as a
        coder as well as contribute to the business in meaningful ways.
